## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing food delivery data for **Porter**, a digital delivery platform.

The main goal is to understand the factors that affect **delivery time, order volume, restaurant performance, and delivery partner availability**. The analysis is performed in **Microsoft Excel** using formulas, Pivot Tables, and charts.

The project helps identify delivery patterns and provides useful insights that can support better operational and business decisions.

- Analyse delivery performance and delays.
- Understand the impact of delivery partners on delivery time.
- Identify high-performing and low-performing stores.
- Compare delivery performance across different order protocols.
- Analyse customer ordering patterns and repeat customers.

## 🗂️ Dataset Columns

The dataset contains information related to food delivery orders.

- **market_id** – Identifier for the market.
- **created_at** – Date and time when the order was placed.
- **actual_delivery_time** – Actual date and time when the order was delivered.
- **store_primary_category** – Primary category of the restaurant.
- **order_protocol** – Method through which the order was placed.
- **total_items** – Total number of items in the order.
- **subtotal** – Final price/value of the order.
- **num_distinct_items** – Number of different items in the order.
- **min_item_price** – Lowest item price in the order.
- **max_item_price** – Highest item price in the order.
- **total_onshift_partners** – Number of delivery partners currently on shift.
- **total_busy_partners** – Number of delivery partners currently busy.
- **total_outstanding_orders** – Number of orders waiting to be fulfilled.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following preparation steps were considered before analysis:

- Handling missing values appropriately.
- Converting date and time columns into proper Excel date/time formats.
- Checking duplicate or inconsistent records.
- Checking categorical columns for unusual or inconsistent values.
- Creating useful calculated fields such as **Delivery Time**, **Day of Week**, and **Hour of Day**.

### Delivery Time Calculation

Delivery time can be calculated using:

**Delivery Time = Actual Delivery Time – Created At**

The calculated delivery time is then used for further analysis.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

### Basic-Level Analysis

The project covers questions such as:

1. What is the distribution of order volumes across different markets?
2. How does average delivery time vary across restaurant categories?
3. What are the peak hours for order placements?
4. Which days of the week have the highest order volume?
5. What is the correlation between the number of items and order subtotal?
6. How is delivery time distributed?
7. What percentage of deliveries take more than 30 minutes?
8. How does delivery time relate to the number of busy delivery partners?
9. What is the impact of the day of the week on average delivery time?
10. Which stores have the highest average delivery time?

### Medium-Level Analysis

The project also includes deeper analysis such as:

- Comparing delivery performance across different order protocols.
- Studying the relationship between order volume and delivery time.
- Analysing the impact of total items and order complexity on delivery time.
- Identifying delivery-time trends throughout the week.
- Studying the role of price range in the total order value.
- Comparing delivery times across restaurant categories.
- Analysing the availability of delivery partners and its impact on delivery time.
- Comparing first-time and repeat customer ordering patterns.
